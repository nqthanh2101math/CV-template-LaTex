- moderncv is incompatible with biber.
- moderncv is incompatible with BibLaTeX.
- moderncv is incompatible with babel in Spanish.

- Skill matrices don't break automatically in fancy style.
- Long names break the oldstyle style and possibly other styles (needs testing).
- Long URLs in classic style can make the name break line. Fixed width for the address part must be implemented.
- When using the fancy style, undesired space is added between the bibliography head and the first entry, as well as after the last entry.
- Footnotes generate errors, but the output seems correct when running with "-interaction=nonstopmode"
- When using CJK, the last \clearpage required for the fancyhdr package to work properly kills the "lastpage" counter, and therefore also the page numbering.
- moderncv produces an error "lonely \item--perhaps a missing list environment" when used with the bibentry package, though the output is actually correct. Among other things, this causes compilation by LyX to stop.
- The space after a \cventry gets eaten up when the last argument contains a nested itemize environment. An ugly hack and incomplete solution was implemented by including a \strut in every item label, but this doesn't solve the problem for multi-line items. Ideally, the \strut should end the item, but there seems to be no way to do this.
